Beginning Web Development
================================

As part of this series of assignments in web development, we'll be creating a new student library application called 'Book Bank'.


After the series you will have a rails application where you can add titles, search for titles, show student profiles and their reading history, with a social element of adding comments, reviews and ratings to the titles.
